# Snake Game in C# and WPF

My take on the implementation of the classic Snake game using C# and Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF). The game is developed in Visual Studio on Windows.

## Game Instructions

1. Use the W (up), A (left), S (down), and D (right) keys or the Arrow Keys to control the movement of the snake.
2. Try to eat the food that appears randomly on the screen.
3. Avoid colliding with the snake's own body and the boundaries of the game area.

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository.
2. Open the solution file in Visual Studio.
3. Build and run the application.

Enjoy the game!

**Note:** This game is intended for educational purposes and as a fun project to learn C# and WPF.
